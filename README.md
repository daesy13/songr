## Challenge Description
Ensure that you can run the Spring app.</br>
Create a hello world route at ```/hello```, and ensure that you can visit that route in your browser and see a rendered template come back.</br>
Create a route that turns words into UPPER CASE. For instance, I should be able to visit ```/capitalize/hello``` and get back an HTML page containing the response HELLO, or I could visit ```/capitalize/```this is Kinda Capitalized and get an HTML page containing the response THIS IS KINDA CAPITALIZED.</br>
Create a basic splash page for the Songr app, available at the root route, and style it appropriately with CSS.</br>
Create an Album class to act as a model in our app.</br>
An Album has a title, an artist, a songCount, a length (in seconds), and an imageUrl that is a link to that album’s art.</br>
Create a route at /albums that shows three album instances. (These will be hardcoded for today’s lab; create an array that contains three albums, and then display those three on the page.)</br>

## How to Run Application
- First run the application from IntellJ.
- After that, go to chrome or any browser and type http://localhost:8080/home to visit the main page.
- To visit the second page type http://localhost:8080/capitalize/any-word-goes-here
- User can type any word where "any-word-goes-here" to see it capitalize.
- Last, type http://localhost8080/albums where a list of albums information will show.
- On this location the user can add more albums to our database.
